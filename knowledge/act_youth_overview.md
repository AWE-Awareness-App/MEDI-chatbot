# Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) in Youth

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a behavioral therapy approach that aims to increase psychological flexibility.

Core processes include:
- Acceptance
- Cognitive defusion
- Present-moment awareness
- Values clarification
- Committed action

In clinical youth populations, ACT has shown outcomes comparable to active treatments such as CBT.

ACT appears especially helpful in managing:
- Anxiety disorders
- Depressive symptoms
- Emotional regulation difficulties

Research suggests ACT fulfills criteria for empirically supported therapy in young populations, though further large-scale trials are recommended.

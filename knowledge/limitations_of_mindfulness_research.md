# Limitations in Mindfulness Research in Youth

Although evidence is promising, several limitations exist:

- Many studies lack blinded outcome assessment
- Sample sizes are sometimes small
- Intervention formats vary widely
- Publication bias may influence results

Therefore, mindfulness interventions should be presented as supportive tools rather than definitive treatments.

Large-scale randomized trials are still needed.

# Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) in Youth

Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) is an 8-week structured intervention focusing on awareness and regulation.

In randomized controlled trials involving adolescents:

- MBSR improved anxiety symptoms
- MBSR improved stress scores
- MBSR improved depressive symptoms in nonclinical samples

Improvements were sustained at follow-up in several studies.

The intervention format varies across studies, and delivery modifications are common in youth settings.

Evidence quality has improved over time, but more rigorous blinded trials are needed.

OVERVIEW
Meditation exercises can be very simple (like mindful breathing) or more structured (like body scan, loving-kindness, or guided imagery). Any activity that helps quiet the mind and bring attention to the present moment can be a meditative practice.

MEDI USE
- Offer 1 exercise at a time.
- Keep it short (1–5 minutes unless user asks longer).
- For stress/anxiety: start with breathing or grounding.
- For sleep: use wind-down + visualization.
- Avoid medical claims; frame as “may help”.

CORE PRACTICES (Short Menu)

1. One Minute of Mindfulness (60 seconds)
Steps:
- Set a timer for 60 seconds.
- Breathe normally and place attention on the breath.
- If the mind wanders, gently return to the breath.

2. Counting the Breath (2–10 minutes)
Steps:
- Sit comfortably.
- Inhale and count “1”, exhale slowly.
- Inhale “2”, exhale slowly.
- Continue up to 10, then restart at 1.

3. Body Scan (3–10 minutes)
Steps:
- Sit or lie down.
- Bring attention to feet and toes.
- Slowly move attention up the body (legs → hips → belly → chest → shoulders → arms → face).
- If you notice tension, breathe out and soften that area.

4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation (5–10 minutes)
Steps:
- Get comfortable.
- Tense one muscle group for ~5 seconds, then release.
- Move through the body (feet → legs → stomach → shoulders → face).
- Notice the contrast between tense and relaxed.

5. Diaphragmatic (Belly) Breathing (3–5 minutes)
Steps:
- One hand on chest, one on belly.
- Inhale through the nose so the belly rises.
- Exhale slowly (longer than inhale if possible).
- Repeat gently.

BREATHING OPTIONS (Use carefully)

A. Relaxing 4–7–8 (use max 4 cycles if new)
Steps:
- Inhale 4 seconds
- Hold 7 seconds
- Exhale 8 seconds
Note: If lightheaded, stop and return to normal breathing.

B. Stimulating “Bellows Breath” (advanced; can cause dizziness)
Steps:
- Sit tall.
- Rapid equal inhales/exhales through the nose for 10–15 seconds.
- Stop, breathe normally.
Note: Skip if dizziness, panic feelings, or heart issues—use slow breathing instead.

----------------------------------------
SLEEP PRACTICES

1. Visualization (2–5 minutes)
Steps:
- Close eyes and imagine a peaceful place (beach, forest, park).
- Add senses: sounds, warmth, smells.
- If thoughts come, notice them and return to the scene.

2. Blackboard Countdown
Steps:
- Imagine a blackboard.
- Write “100” and erase it slowly.
- Continue 99, 98… until sleepy.

----------------------------------------
FOCUS PRACTICE

Focused Attention (2–5 minutes)
Steps:
- Choose an object (candle, stone, mug).
- Study it briefly, then close eyes and imagine details.
- If mind wanders, return to the object.

----------------------------------------
BEGINNER PRACTICES

Walking Meditation (3–10 minutes)
Steps:
- Walk slowly in a quiet place.
- Notice footsteps, breath, and surroundings.
- When distracted, return attention to walking.

Gratitude Practice (1–3 minutes)
Steps:
- Take a slow breath.
- Mentally list 3–7 things you’re grateful for.
- Let the feeling of appreciation be enough.

MEDI SAFE PHRASES
- “We can try one simple practice together.”
- “If this feels uncomfortable, we can switch to something gentler.”
- “You don’t have to do it perfectly—just return to the breath.”

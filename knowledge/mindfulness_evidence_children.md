# Mindfulness-Based Interventions in Children and Adolescents

Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) are structured programs that cultivate present-moment awareness and non-judgmental attention.

A 2015 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in children and adolescents found that mindfulness-based interventions can improve:

- Anxiety symptoms
- Stress levels
- Depressive symptoms
- Quality of life indicators

Most interventions were brief (6–12 weeks) and group-based.

Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) showed the strongest empirical support.

However, results should be interpreted cautiously due to:
- Publication bias
- Small sample sizes in some studies
- Heterogeneity in intervention formats

Mindfulness interventions appear to be a useful adjunct for emotional regulation in youth populations.

OVERVIEW

Polyvagal Theory explains how the autonomic nervous system shapes emotional regulation, safety, stress response, and social connection.

The theory proposes a hierarchical system:

1. Ventral Vagal (Safety & Connection)
2. Sympathetic (Fight or Flight)
3. Dorsal Vagal (Shutdown / Freeze)

Our ability to feel safe and connect is biologically embedded in the vagus nerve.

----------------------------------------

CORE IDEAS

Ventral Vagal System (Social Engagement System)
- Supports calm states
- Enables facial expression and vocal prosody
- Promotes connection and co-regulation
- Allows flexible stress recovery

Sympathetic System
- Mobilization
- Fight / flight response
- Increased heart rate

Dorsal Vagal System
- Shutdown / immobilization
- Numbness
- Energy conservation

----------------------------------------

KEY CLINICAL INSIGHT

Many mental health symptoms reflect autonomic state, not personal failure.

Examples:
- Anxiety = sympathetic dominance
- Dissociation = dorsal vagal shutdown
- Trauma = impaired access to ventral vagal regulation

Healing involves restoring access to safety signals.

----------------------------------------

NEUROCEPTION

The nervous system unconsciously detects safety or threat.
This process is called "neuroception."

If neuroception is biased toward danger:
- The body stays in defense
- Social connection becomes difficult

----------------------------------------

RESEARCH & MEASUREMENT

Physiological markers include:
- Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)
- Vagal Efficiency
- Weighted Coherence

These reflect autonomic flexibility.

----------------------------------------

INTERVENTIONS THAT SUPPORT REGULATION

- Slow breathing
- Prosodic voice
- Co-regulation
- Safe relational presence
- Rhythm-based practices
- Vagus nerve stimulation
- Acoustic interventions (e.g., SSP)

----------------------------------------

MEDI-SAFE LANGUAGE

Instead of:
“Weighted coherence reflects cardiopulmonary oscillator dynamics.”

MEDI should say:
• “Your nervous system may be stuck in a stress state.”
• “We can gently guide your body back to safety.”
• “Connection and rhythm help regulate the nervous system.”

----------------------------------------

IMPORTANT BOUNDARY

Polyvagal Theory explains regulation patterns.
It does not diagnose conditions.
It supports understanding of stress and trauma responses.
